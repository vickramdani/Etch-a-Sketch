In this project, i build some sketch panel in pixel rate with simple javascript.

To play this Etch-a-Sketch, the first thing to do is input your desired number of dimension. And then pick your grid color. You can pick colorful or monochrome. Finally, you can sketch whatever you want. if you want to change the dimension and the color, you can just press reset button.
